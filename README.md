> Real-time guitar tuner built in python using PyQt6 for GUI, along with sounddevice and SciPy for audio input

> Audio input and frequency calculations from https://www.chciken.com/digital/signal/processing/2020/05/13/guitar-tuner.html / https://github.com/not-chciken

This project was very fun to work on a was a great learning experience. There was definitely a bit of a learning curve at first with the audio input and frequency detection, but the walkthrough made by chciken helped lots. 
From my project I was able to learn more about how classes work along with GUI design in python.
